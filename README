DracoDice, by kafkaEsc

DracoDice is push-your-luck dice game based heavily on the games Pig and 
Zombie Dice. The theme is that players are trying to loot a dragon's den. 

Each dice roll has three possbile outcomes: successful looting, a possible 
reattempt, or a burn from the dragon.

There are three different kinds of dice: gold, silver, and bronze. They 
represent the different kinds of loot in the dragon's den. The more valuable 
the loot, the more strongly the dragon prizes it, and thus more risky to swipe.

Gold has 1/6 chance of success, 3/6 chance of a burn, and 2/6 chance to retry.
Silver has 2/6 chance of success, 2/6 chance of a burn, and 2/6 chance to retry.
Bronze has 3/6 chance of success, 1/6 chance of a burn, and 2/6 chance to retry.

After a player roles, he collects point and takes on burns. He can then choose 
which dice he wants to re-roll. The player's points becomes permanent once 
she is no longer rolling dice. If a player has five burns a state of 
burnination is reached and they player loses all points and is out of the round.
